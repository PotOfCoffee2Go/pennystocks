Some stocks just do not work well with the strategy your using. The [[simple strategy|Simple Strategy]] I use is basically [[average-in|Average In]] when the stock is going down and exit the position in one order when it goes up. Some stocks just don't play nice when using that strategy! [[Realize|Realized]] the loss and move on.
