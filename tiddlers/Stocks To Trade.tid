title: Stocks To Trade
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

Finding what stocks to trade can easily be found by any online ''Screener'' site (I use 'Finviz Screener'). Filter by price less than a dollar to view the stocks currently of interest. There is an advantage in trading stocks on NASDAQ due to the companies are monitored to insure they are compliant with NASDAQ and SEC reporting requirements. Well, other than bid price being under $1.
